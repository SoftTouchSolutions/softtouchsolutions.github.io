		</div>
		<p>The interface of the Personal Tutor has been designed to be easy and intuitive 
			to use. You will find that you can start work straight away, without reading 
			any documentation. Most of the pages in the Personal Tutor have an 'About...' 
			section at the bottom of the page; click on this to get concise help about that 
			page.</p>
		<h5 class="fpq">Step-by-step example of working with the Personal Tutor</h5>
		<h6 class="fpq">Choosing Part I or Part II</h6>
		<p>Just as in <i>Engineering Mathematics</i> 6th edition, the contents of the 
			Personal Tutor are divided into two main parts: <b><i>Part&#160;I,&#160;Foundation&#160;Topics</i></b>
			and <b><i>Part&#160;II</i></b>. The first menu in the Personal Tutor asks you 
			to choose the part you want to work in.</p>
		<p><img src="../img/m_01.gif" height="110" width="310" alt="" title="Part menu selection"></p>
		<ul class="rwk">
			<li class="rwk">
				<b><i>Part&#160;I,&#160;Foundation&#160;Topics</i></b> contains revision 
				material that is essential for the first year of an undergraduate degree in 
				Engineering or Science.</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				<b><i>Part&#160;II</i></b> contains material that is selectively essential 
				depending upon the type of Engineering or Science degree you are studying.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note that there is a 'navigation bar' at the top of every page in the Personal 
			Tutor. This not only shows you where you are in the program, it allows you to 
			jump directly to 'parent' sections.<br />
			<img src="../img/m_14.gif" alt="" title="The navigation bar" height="110" width="462">
		</p>
		<h6 class="fpq">Choosing a topic</h6>
		<p><img src="../img/m_02.gif" height="80" width="310" alt="" title="Topic menu selection"></p>
		<p>The next menu after you have chosen a part will ask you to choose a topic. The 
			topics correspond to those in <i>Engineering Mathematics</i> 6th edition, with 
			the exception of Programme F.4 'Graphs' in Part I Foundation Topics, which is 
			not available in the Personal Tutor.</p>
		<h6 class="fpq">Choosing a section</h6>
		<p><img src="../img/m_03.gif" height="96" width="310" alt="" title="Section menu selection"></p>
		<p>As in the book, each topic is divided into a number of sections:</p>
		<ul class="rwk">
			<li class="rwk">
				<b>Quizzes:</b> These questions are designed to ascertain your knowledge and 
				understanding of the revision material of Part I <b>before</b> you study it in <i>Engineering 
					Mathematics</i> 6th edition. Quizzes are only present in Part I, Foundation 
				Topics.</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				<b>Test exercises:</b> These questions are designed to ascertain your knowledge 
				and understanding of the revision material of Part I <b>after</b> you have 
				studied it in <i>Engineering Mathematics</i> 6th edition.</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				<b>Further problems:</b> These questions are more difficult and are designed to 
				challenge your understanding of the material. Attempting these will extend your 
				mathematical abilities because they generally require more previously acquired 
				knowledge.</li>
		</ul>
		<h6 class="fpq">Choosing a question</h6>
		<p><img src="../img/m_04.gif" height="80" width="310" alt="" title="Question selection"></p>
		<ul class="rwk">
			<li class="rwk">
				The next menu after you have chosen a section lists the questions in that 
				section. The questions are a subset of the questions available in <i>Engineering 
					Mathematics</i> 6th edition.</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				<a name="q012"></a>When you have completed a question, a tick symbol&#160;<img src="../img/tick.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="" title="Tick symbol indicates that a question has been done.">&#160;will 
				appear opposite the menu entry for that question. You can do a question as 
				often as you want, and break off at any point during the question.</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				If cookies are enabled on your browser the program will remember what you have 
				done from session to session.</li>
		</ul>
		<h6 class="fpq">Doing a question</h6>
		<p><img src="../img/m_05.gif" height="376" width="510" alt="" title="The question interface"></p>
		<ul class="rwk">
			<li class="rwk">
				Each question consists of one or more steps leading to the solution of the 
				question. The steps appear in the centre section of the question screen. A 
				'step bar' just below the title of the question shows you how many steps there 
				are in the question. The number of your current step is highlighted.
			</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				You cannot jump ahead in the steps; for obvious reasons it only makes sense to 
				start at step one and work through the steps in sequence until you reach the 
				last step.</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				You can, however, jump back by clicking an earlier step number in the step bar, 
				in which case you will see the completed version of that step. Your results in 
				the previous steps are 'frozen', that is, you cannot rework steps you have 
				already done.</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				You can jump out of a question at any time by returning to a menu using the 
				navigation bar. Your work will not be saved, though, so that if you return to 
				the question you will have to do it afresh.</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#dd0000">Warning</span>: Pressing the 
				'Refresh' button on your browser (or pressing the 'F5' key) will restart the 
				current exercise, clearing any work you have already done and returning you to 
				step 1.</li>
		</ul>
		<h6 class="fpq">Doing a step</h6>
		<ul class="rwk">
			<li class="rwk">
				Each step consists of two parts:<br />
				&#151;&#160;The top part of the step (the part with a pale grey background) is 
				the step task. It shows you the initial question (in step 1) or the solution to 
				the previous step (in steps 2 and onwards).<br />
				&#151;&#160;The lower part of the step contains the step input. It has a number 
				of input fields, which appear as grey boxes. The currently active field is 
				shown by a yellow box. 'Currently active' means that if you press a key, your 
				input will be entered into that field.
			</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				You can select a field by clicking on it with the cursor, in which case the 
				field will 'open up' ready for your input. You can also move the selection from 
				field to field using the arrow keys. When you select a field using the arrow 
				keys the field does not open automatically, as it does when you click on a 
				field. You need to open the field by pressing 'Return' (which will open an 
				empty field) or a character key, in which case the field will be opened and the 
				character inserted into it straight away.</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				As soon as you press a key the active field 'opens up' into a small frame into 
				which you can type (and edit, if necessary) your answer. Pressing the Return 
				key, selecting a different field or just clicking off the field with the cursor 
				will close the input frame and enter your answer into the field. <img src="../img/m_07.gif" height="80" width="280" alt="" title="An open input field">
			</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				The Personal Tutor may modify your answer before entering it into the field; 
				superfluous spaces will be removed, for example. There is usually also a limit 
				on the number of characters you can enter into a particular field.</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				The answers in most fields are treated as case-sensitive, that is entering 
				'SIN' where 'sin' is required will be marked as incorrect.</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				When a field 'opens up' for input, any previous content of the field is 
				discarded.</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				The input help table immediately underneath the step section contains special 
				characters that are not available on standard keyboards. If you click on a 
				character in this table or select it using the control key combination in the 
				legend at the bottom of the table, that character will be placed into the 
				active field.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h6 class="fpq">Checking your answers in a step</h6>
		<p>When you have completed all the fields in the step &#151;&#160;or, in fact, at 
			any time&#160;&#151; you can click the <b>Check your answers</b> button (or 
			press 'Control' plus 'Return') to evaluate (that is, mark) your work.</p>
		<p><img src="../img/m_08.gif" height="280" width="410" alt="" title="Checking your answers"></p>
		<ul class="rwk">
			<li class="rwk">
				<a name="q010"></a>Fields containing incorrect answers are marked in red, those 
				with correct answers in green.<br />
				<img src="../img/m_09.gif" height="280" width="410" alt="" title="Some answers correct, some incorrect; try again...">
			</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				You can have up to three attempts at getting all the fields of a step correct.<br />
				<img src="../img/m_10.gif" height="280" width="410" alt="" title="Checking your answers again"><br />
				If you get a field correct after one or more attempts, it is marked in a paler 
				shade of green than fields you did correctly at the first attempt.<br />
				<img src="../img/m_11.gif" height="280" width="410" alt="" title="Some answers now correct at the second attempt, some still incorrect; try again...">
			</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				If you run out of attempts and still have incorrect fields the program will 
				show you the correct answers and mark their fields in a pale blue colour.<br />
				<img src="../img/m_12.gif" height="280" width="410" alt="" title="All attempts used up; the incorrect answers have been corrected; go to the next step.">
			</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				If you have completed all the fields correctly or have run out of attempts you 
				can move on to the next step by pressing the 'Go to the next step' button or 
				pressing 'Control' plus 'Return'. On completing the last step in a question the 
				button will display 'Go to the next exercise' &#151;&#160;unless, of course, 
				this is the last question in the section. Clicking the button or pressing 
				'Control' plus 'Return' will take you to the next exercise in the current 
				section.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Note that the Personal Tutor is not a test system: you can revisit a question and 
				improve your scores.</b></p>
		<h6 class="fpq">Getting help</h6>
		<p>You can get help on doing steps and questions from a number of features in the 
			Personal Tutor:</p>
		<ul class="rwk">
			<li class="rwk">
				If you need help with a step click the <b>Show a hint</b> button. Click the 
				button again to hide the hint.<br />
				<img src="../img/m_06.gif" height="110" width="510" alt="" title="Displaying the hint">
			</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				The <b>Show full working</b> button will display the working for the entire 
				question in a popup window.<br />
				<img src="../img/btn_showFull_0.gif" height="30" width="174" alt="" title="Show full working button">
			</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				The <b>Table of standard forms</b> underneath the hint allows you to look up 
				standard forms quickly at any time.</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				A <b>frame reference</b> next to the symbol&#160;<img src="../img/frames.gif" height="12" width="16" alt="" title="Frame reference symbol">&#160;gives 
				the frame number(s) in <i>Engineering Mathematics</i> 6th edition that are 
				relevant to the current step.</li>
		</ul>
		<h6 class="fpq">Using the mouse and using the keyboard</h6>
		<p><a name="q011"></a>When working through steps and questions, nearly every action 
			you can carry out with the mouse can also be done using the keyboard.</p>
		<ul class="rwk">
			<li class="rwk">
				<b>Navigation keys</b> (mainly the arrow keys on your keyboard) move the 
				currently active selection from field to field in ways you would expect. When a 
				field is open and receiving your input, these keys than allow you to move 
				around within the field and select and edit your input.</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				<b>Character shortcuts</b> listed along the bottom of the input help table 
				allow you to enter special characters directly from the keyboard. For example, 
				'Control' plus 'l' will enter a lower-case greek lambda into the input field, 
				'Control' plus 'L' will enter an upper-case greek lambda into the input field.<br />
				<img src="../img/m_13.gif" alt="" title="The input help table" height="68" width="670"><br />
				Note that the Greek characters in the input help table are in the traditional 
				order of the Greek alphabet. In contrast, the shortcut keys are not in 
				alphabetical order since, as far as possible, English letters have been 
				associated with Greek letters in a meaningful way. Thus 'g' has been associated 
				with gamma, '&#x03B3;', making it the third not the seventh letter of the 
				sequence of English letters.
			</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				<b>Control keys</b>. 'Return' closes an open field and moves the selection onto 
				the next field. It will also open a closed field ready for input (although any 
				key will do this). 'Control' plus 'Return' is the equivalent of clicking on the <b>Check 
					your answers</b>, <b>Try again</b>, <b>Go to next step</b> or <b>Go to next 
					exercise</b> buttons (depending on the context).</li>
		</ul>
