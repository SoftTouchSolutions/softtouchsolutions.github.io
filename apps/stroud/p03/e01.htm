		<h5 class="fpq">Installing the Stroud <i>Engineering Mathematics</i> Personal 
			Tutor</h5>
		<p>The Personal Tutor does not need to be installed on your computer.</p>
		<ul class="rwk">
			<li class="rwk">
				Put the CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive. The Personal Tutor will start 
				automatically.</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				<a name="q015"></a>If the Personal Tutor does not start automatically it may be 
				that this feature is disabled on your computer.<br />
				In this case, with the Personal Tutor CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive, open Windows 
				Explorer (on most computers accessible via 'Start/Programs/Accessories/Windows 
				Explorer'), navigate to the CD-ROM drive and double click on the file 
				'PersonalTutor.htm'. Your internet browser will open and display the Personal 
				Tutor home page.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 class="fpq">Running the Personal Tutor</h5>
		<p>The Personal Tutor runs in the default internet browser on your computer. You 
			must have an internet browser installed on your computer to be able to use the 
			Personal Tutor.</p>
		<ul class="rwk">
			<li class="rwk">
				When started from the CD-ROM, the Personal Tutor works entirely offline. Your 
				computer does not need to be connected to the internet.</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				This version of Personal Tutor works on PCs with recent versions of many 
				different types of internet browsers: Internet Explorer (v. 6 and 7), recent 
				versions of Mozilla/Firefox (v. 1.5+), Netscape (v.7.1) and Opera (version 
				9.02+). Developments in these browsers after the publication of the CD-ROM 
				version of the Personal Tutor may mean that you need to upgrade your copy of 
				the program. See the <a href="e05.htm">Contacts</a> section for the link you 
				can use to do this.
			</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				Because the Personal Tutor runs in your internet browser, you can bookmark its 
				start page just as you would a website.</li>
			<li class="rwk">
				Depending on the type of your browser and its security settings, you may need 
				to manually enable scripts for the Personal Tutor. Consult your browser 
				documentation on how to do this.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 class="fpq">Hardware and software requirements for the Personal Tutor</h5>
		<p>If your computer supports any of the browsers listed above then it will run the 
			Personal Tutor satisfactorily. Your computer should have a display of at least 
			800 pixels in width, but the larger the display area the easier it will be to 
			work with the Personal Tutor.</p>
		<h5 class="fpq">If you experience difficulty starting or running the 
			Personal Tutor</h5>
		<p>Consult the <a href="e04.htm">Frequently Asked Questions</a> section. If this 
			does not help you to solve the problem then see the <a href="e05.htm">Contacts</a>
			section for the link you can use to get help.</p>
