		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q001"></a>Can I run the Personal Tutor from the 
			hard disk of my computer?</h5>
		<p>Yes. Copy the entire contents of the CD-ROM to a suitable folder on your 
			hard-disk. The Personal Tutor requires about 55&#160;MB of hard disk space. 
			Start the Personal Tutor by navigating to its folder using Windows Explorer and 
			double-clicking on the file 'PersonalTutor.htm'. This will open up your default 
			browser. Bookmark the Personal Tutor start page in your browser just as you 
			would an internet website.</p>
		<p>By doing this the Personal Tutor will not be 'installed' in the technical sense 
			on your computer, that is, you will not find an entry for it in the 'Add and 
			Remove Software' utility. To completely remove the Personal Tutor from your 
			computer simply delete the entire file structure from the folder into which you 
			copied it.</p>
		<p><b>Important note 1</b>: The copyright and licence agreement for the Personal 
			Tutor allows you to keep a copy of the Personal Tutor on the hard disk of your 
			computer. This copy is for personal use only: you are NOT allowed to install 
			the Personal Tutor in a multi-user environment (such as on a file server). 
			Refer to the <a href="e06.htm">Licence Agreement and Copyright Statement</a>.</p>
		<p><b>Important note 2</b>: Only copy and run authentic versions of the Personal 
			Tutor. <b>If you have any doubts about the authenticity of the Personal Tutor 
				program
				<span style="color:#ff0000">DO NOT USE IT</span></b>. Palgrave Macmillan 
			Ltd cannot accept liability for damage resulting from the use of copies of the 
			Personal Tutor that have been modified or contain malicious code. See <a class="rwk" href="#q014">
				Browser warning</a>.</p>
		<p><a class="rwk" href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q002"></a>Can I access the Personal Tutor on a 
			website?</h5>
		<p>Yes. Visit the <a href="http://www.palgrave.com/stroud/personaltutor" target="_blank">
				Stroud <i>Engineering Mathematics</i> Personal Tutor website</a>. The 
			online version of the Personal Tutor may contain additional features that are 
			not found in the CD-ROM version.&#160;&#160;<a class="rwk" href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q003"></a>What is the relationship of the 
			Personal Tutor and the <i>Engineering Mathematics</i> book?</h5>
		<p>The Personal Tutor contains a subset of the exercises contained in the book <i>Engineering 
				Mathematics</i> 6th edition. It is designed as a complement to the book and 
			not as a stand-alone product.</p>
		<p>The questions in the Personal Tutor are broken down into steps. The Personal 
			Tutor does not contain the explanatory material that is in the book, but each 
			step of a question gives a reference to the relevant explanatory 'frame(s)' in 
			the book.</p>
		<p>The book <i>Engineering Mathematics</i> 6th edition is an essential requirement 
			for the effective use of the Personal Tutor as a learning tool.&#160;&#160;<a class="rwk" href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q004"></a>Why are there only odd-numbered 
			questions on the Personal Tutor?</h5>
		<p>The question numbers refer to all the odd-numbered Quiz, Test exercise and 
			Further problem sections from the textbook <i>Engineering Mathematics</i> 6th 
			edition, by K. A. Stroud with additions by Dexter J. Booth.&#160;&#160;<a class="rwk" href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q005"></a>Why are there no questions for 
			Programme F.4 Graphs?</h5>
		<p>The Graphs topic does not lend itself to the Personal Tutor 
			software.&#160;&#160;<a class="rwk" href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q006"></a>What are&#160;<img src="../img/frames.gif" height="12" width="16" alt="" title="Frame reference symbol">&#160;Frames?</h5>
		<p>These refer you to the numbered frames in the equivalent Programme in the <i>Engineering 
				Mathematics</i> 6th edition textbook. If you can't do the question and the 
			Hint and Full working aren't helping, refer back to the book for more 
			help.&#160;&#160;<a class="rwk" href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q007"></a>Where can I buy <i>Engineering Mathematics</i>
			6th edition by K. A. Stroud with additions by Dexter J. Booth?</h5>
		<p>It is stocked in most university bookshops, is through online bookstores or 
			direct from <a href="http://www.palgrave.com" target="_blank">the publishers</a>.&#160;&#160;<a class="rwk" href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q008"></a>Will the Personal Tutor run on a Unix 
			or Linux computer?</h5>
		<p>Yes, if it is running one of the browsers listed in the <a href="e03.htm">Installing 
				and running the Personal Tutor</a> section.&#160;&#160;<a class="rwk" href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q009"></a>Will the Personal Tutor run on 
			Apple&#160;Mac computers?</h5>
		<p>Perhaps. The Personal Tutor is not supported and has not been tested on 
			Apple&#160;Mac computers. It may run adequately in recent versions of the 
			Konqueror browser, but this is not assured.&#160;&#160;<a class="rwk" href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q010"></a>What do the colours that are shown when 
			I check my answers mean?</h5>
		<p>The meaning of the colours is explained in detail in <a href="e03.htm#q010">Using 
				the Personal Tutor: Checking your answers in a step</a>.&#160;&#160;<a class="rwk" href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q011"></a>Can I work with the Personal Tutor 
			using the keyboard?</h5>
		<p>Yes. The use of keyboard shortcuts is explained in detail in <a href="e03.htm#q011">Using 
				the Personal Tutor: Using the mouse and using the keyboard</a>.&#160;&#160;<a class="rwk" href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q012"></a>What does the tick symbol <img src="../img/tick.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="">
			in the question menu mean?</h5>
		<p>A tick symbol opposite a question entry means that you have completed that 
			question by working through all the steps it contains. It isn't a score: it 
			doesn't mean that you answered all or even any of the questions correctly. See <a href="e03.htm#q012">
				Using the Personal Tutor: Choosing a question</a>.&#160;&#160;<a class="rwk" href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q013"></a>Are there updates available for the 
			Personal Tutor?</h5>
		<p>From time to time the software and or the content of the Personal Tutor may be 
			updated or extended. Visit the <a href="http://www.palgrave.com/stroud" target="_blank">
				Stroud website</a> for news about the Personal Tutor and and downloads and 
			updates that may be available.&#160;&#160;<a class="rwk" href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q014"></a>My browser gave me a warning that the 
			Personal Tutor may not be safe to use. What do I do?</h5>
		<p>The Personal Tutor uses JavaScript scripts, a technique that is used extremely 
			widely in web pages. Your browser may be set to warn you when a page contains 
			such scripts or even block them completely. You can trust the scripts in the 
			Personal Tutor as long as (1) you are running the program from a genuine CD-ROM 
			that you obtained as part of your purchase of <i>Engineering Mathematics</i> 6th 
			edition or (2) you are running the Personal Tutor either directly from the 
			online Stroud Personal Tutor website or (3) you are running the program from a 
			download you obtained directly from the Stroud website.</p>
		<p><b>If you have any doubts about the authenticity of the Personal Tutor program
				<span style="color:#ff0000">DO NOT USE IT</span></b>. Palgrave Macmillan 
			Ltd cannot accept liability for damage resulting from the use of copies of the 
			Personal Tutor that have been modified or contain malicious code. &#160;&#160;<a class="rwk" href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q015"></a>Why won't the Personal Tutor start 
			automatically when I put the CD-ROM in the drive?</h5>
		<p>The CD-ROM 'autorun' feature may have been disabled on your computer. See <a href="e01.htm#q015">
				Installing and running the Personal Tutor</a>.&#160;&#160;<a class="rwk" href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q016"></a>Do I need to have cookies enabled in my 
			browser?</h5>
		<p>Cookies are not essential: the Personal Tutor will run correctly without them, 
			but the record of the questions you have done (the tick symbols <img src="../img/tick.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="">
			in the question menus) will be lost when you close or refresh the browser or 
			navigate away from the program. This record will be stored between sessions if 
			you have cookies enabled. Whether you are using the CD-ROM version or the 
			website version of the Personal Tutor, no information from the cookie is sent 
			to Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.&#160;&#160;<a class="rwk" href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q017"></a>How do I clear all the tick symbols?</h5>
		<p>Delete the cookie. How you do this depends on the browser you are using. Consult 
			the documentation for your browser.&#160;&#160;<a class="rwk" href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
		<h5 class="fpq"><a name="q018"></a>If other people use my computer, will 
			this change the record of the questions I have done?</h5>
		<p>If each person using the computer has and uses their own username then your 
			records will be unaffected by anything the other users do in the Personal 
			Tutor. If, on the other hand, all users of the computer are 'guests' without 
			their own username, or if other people login under your username, then what 
			they do will affect your records.</p>
